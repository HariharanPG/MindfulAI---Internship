# MindfulAI---Internship

Welcome to my LangChain internship project! During this internship, I had the chance to learn about Large Language Models (LLMs), how they work, and how tokens play a key role in processing text. This README will walk you through what I learned and the project I built based on the internship's teachings.

## What I Learned

1. **What are LLMs?**
   - Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on huge datasets.
   - They can perform tasks like answering questions, summarizing text, and even generating code!

2. **What are Tokens?**
   - Tokens are the building blocks of text that LLMs use. Instead of processing whole words, LLMs break down sentences into smaller units called tokens.
   - For example, "hello" might be one token, but a longer word like "elephant" could be split into two tokens.
   - The number of tokens affects the model's performance and output quality.

3. **Building a Framework:**
   - As part of the internship, I built a framework that incorporates everything I learned about LLMs, tokens, and AI.
   - This framework can be used to interact with language models and perform tasks like text generation or summarization.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **LangChain Framework**: To build and manage the LLM interaction
- **Python**: For coding and scripting the framework
- **LLMs**: Used for natural language processing tasks
- **Tokenization Tools**: To handle text processing efficiently

## Conclusion

This internship gave me hands-on experience with LLMs, teaching me how these models are built, how they process language, and how to develop frameworks using them.
